# Employee Programming Language Probability Calculator

This project calculates the **conditional probability** of a programming language given a company:

This exercise is based on the problem statement from **[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@gtarawneh/HkzQJm-9kl)**.

```

## ðŸ”§ How It Works
1. **Filter Employees** â€“ Keep only employees who worked at 3+ companies.
2. **Count Employees Per Company** â€“ Get the total number of employees for each company.
3. **Count Employees Per Language** â€“ Count how many employees at each company know each programming language.
4. **Calculate Probability** â€“ Compute **P(language | company)** using the formula above.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install Python (if not installed).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MuathOthman/EmployeeProgrammingLanguageProbabilityCalculator.git
   cd EmployeeProgrammingLanguageProbabilityCalculator/src/
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
4. The calculated probabilities will be saved in **probabilities.json** and displayed.

## ðŸ“Š Example Output
```
P(Go | Meta) = 0.56
P(Rust | Netflix) = 0.62
P(Python | Facebook) = 0.50
```
